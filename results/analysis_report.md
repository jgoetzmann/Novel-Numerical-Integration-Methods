# Updated Trial Analysis: Trials 8-16 (Including Trial 16)

## Executive Summary

This updated analysis evaluates trials 8-16 from the Novel Numerical Integration Methods project, now including Trial 16 with full performance evaluation.

### Key Findings

1. **Gradient Descent Convergence to Local Minima**: Trials 8-10 (gradient descent) consistently converged to similar Butcher table structures, indicating local minimum trapping.

4. **Testing Scale Discrepancy**: Other trials were tested on only 500 ODEs, while Trial 16 was evaluated on 10,000 ODEs, making direct comparison challenging.

## Methodology

- **Analysis Scope**: All trials with complete performance metrics (now including Trial 16)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Runtime, Accuracy (max error), Stability, Success Rate
- **Baseline Comparison**: Performance normalized against RK4 and RK45 (Dormand-Prince)
- **Ratios**: >1 indicates better performance, <1 indicates worse performance
