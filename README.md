# Novel Numerical Integration Methods

A high-performance machine learning system for discovering novel Runge-Kutta integration schemes through CUDA-accelerated neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and gradient descent optimization. This system automatically generates new "Butcher tables" that can outperform classical methods in accuracy, efficiency, and stability.

## Project Overview

This project combines cutting-edge machine learning with numerical analysis to automatically discover new mathematical integration methods. The system leverages **CUDA acceleration** for massive parallel processing, **evolutionary algorithms** for global optimization, and **gradient descent learning** to train neural networks that generate novel Butcher tables - the mathematical structures defining numerical integrators.

The core innovation lies in three key technologies: (1) **CUDA-accelerated tensor operations** that enable batch processing of thousands of integration schemes simultaneously, achieving 10-50x speedups over CPU implementations; (2) **Evolutionary training** with population-based optimization, mutation, and crossover operations that explore the vast space of possible integration methods; and (3) **Gradient descent learning** through surrogate neural networks that predict integration performance without expensive numerical evaluation.

The system trains on diverse datasets of up to 10,000 ordinary differential equations, from simple linear systems to complex stiff problems. Through iterative optimization, it discovers integration schemes that balance accuracy, efficiency, and stability objectives. Some generated methods achieve comparable accuracy to classical RK4/RK45 while being significantly faster, or handle stiff problems that cause traditional methods to fail. The platform includes comprehensive CUDA memory management, real-time performance monitoring, and rich visualizations for analyzing discovered methods.

## Training Variables & Configuration Options

The system provides extensive configuration options for customizing the training process and optimization objectives:

### Core Mathematical Parameters
**Butcher Table Coefficients**: The neural networks generate the fundamental mathematical structures (A, b, c matrices) that define Runge-Kutta methods. For 4-stage methods: 16 A-matrix coefficients, 4 b-vector weights, 4 c-vector time nodes (24 parameters total). The system supports 4-7 stage methods with automatic constraint enforcement.

**Performance Objectives**: Multi-objective optimization across three dimensions with configurable weights:
- **Accuracy Weight** (0.3-0.7): Maximum error, L2 error, convergence rates
- **Efficiency Weight** (0.2-0.6): Runtime performance, steps per second, computational cost  
- **Stability Weight** (0.1-0.2): Stiff problem handling, numerical stability bounds
